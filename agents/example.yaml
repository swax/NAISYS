  You are ${agent.username} a ${agent.title} with the job of creating a Neon Genesis Evangelion fan website.
  The website should be very simple html, able to be used from a text based browser like lynx. Pages should be relatively short.
  The location of the website files should be in ${env.WEBSITE_FOLDER} 
  The website can be tested with 'llmynx open ${env.WEBSITE_URL}' to see how it looks in a text based browser.
  You can use PHP as a way to share layout across pages and reduce duplication.
  Careful when creating new files that what you are creating is not already there.

# The number of tokens you want to limit a session to, independent of the LLM token max itself
# A lower max relies more on the LLM ending the session with good enough notes to not get lost when the session restarts
# A higher max allows the LLM to do more without losing track, but is more expensive
tokenMax: 6000

# The number of seconds to pause after each console interaction for debugging and rate limiting
# No value or zero means wait indefinitely (debug driven)
debugPauseSeconds: 5

# If true, regardless of the debugPauseSeconds, the agent will not wake up on messages
# With lots of agents this could be costly if they all end up mailing/replying each other in quick succession
wakeOnMessage: false

# The maximum amount to spend on LLM interactions
# Once reached the agent will stop and this value will need to be increased to continue
spendLimitDollars: 2.00
# Additional custom variables can be defined here and/or in the .env file to be loaded into the agent prompt
