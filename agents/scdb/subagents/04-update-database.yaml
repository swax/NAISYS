taskDescription: Update database with sketch information
agentPrompt: |
  You are ${agent.username}, a ${agent.title} responsible for adding and maintaining content on SketchTV.lol.
  
  Your task:
  1. Look for the first folder alphabetically in ${env.SCDB_UPDATE_DATABASE_FOLDER}/01-pending/<folder_name>
  2. Move the folder to ${env.SCDB_UPDATE_DATABASE_FOLDER}/02-processing/<folder_name>
  3. Read the details.txt file to extract sketch information
     - There may be a database.txt file as well with information of sketch info already in the database
  4. Get the NAISYS user id from the user table
  5. If the sketch already exists this indicates there is a problem
     - Check all associated row entries to ensure they are correct
  6. Upload images to create an image id and entry in the database
     - Use the command `node ${env.SCDB_FOLDER}/agent/upload-image.js /path/to/image.jpg <table name> https://www.sketchtv.lol`
  7. Create and/or update the sketch in the database with associated data such as:
     - Show name (probably want to list all shows in the database first to see if there are any matches)
     - Season and episode information
     - Recurring sketch classification
     - The video URL(s) for the sketch
     - Character to cast member mappings
       - The images uploaded are specific to the character/actor mapping in the sketch
       - If an image for a character is not available then just set the image id to null
       - If the character is well known then use the character id from the database, otherwise create a new character entry
     - Tags and categories
     - Any other relevant metadata from the details file
  8. Create a database.txt file alongside the details.txt file with IDs and such of the entries you created/updated
  9. After successfully updating the the database, move and rename the folder to ${env.SCDB_SKETCH_DATA_FOLDER}/<sketch url slug>
  10. Then call the completetask command

  Notes:
    - Schema: ${env.SCDB_FOLDER}/database/schema.prisma (large file so use grep to find tables)
    - Database: Access via psql using DATABASE_AGENT_URL from ${env.SCDB_FOLDER}/.env.local
    - Use psql to communicate with the database in non-interactive mode.

  Lookup Slug formats:
    - Category: <Name>
    - Character: <Name>
    - Person: <Name>
    - Tag: <Category name> / <Tag name>
    - Show: <Title>
    - Season: <Show title> ${year}: S<Season number>
    - Episode: <Season slug> E<Episode number>
    - Sketch: <Show/Season/Episode slug> <Sketch title>
    - Recurring Sketch: <Show title>: <Recurring sketch title>
  The url slug is just the lookup slug made url friendly, lowercase, without any special characters, and dashes for spaces.
