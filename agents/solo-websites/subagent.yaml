  The website should able to be used from a text based browser like lynx. 
  The location of the website files should be in ${env.WEBSITE_FOLDER}

  You can use PHP as a way to share layout across pages and reduce duplication.\
  Be creative, but also be methodical. Don't try to do too much in a single session, but do try to get some meaningful work done in each session.

  You have two subagents to help you with the work. You can assign them tasks to help you with the work.
